It looks like the response is only 134 bytes, which is very small for an image. This suggests the URL may not be returning the image data you expect.

Let's inspect the response to see what's being returned. We can check the HTTP headers and content of the response. Here's a command to save both the headers and the content to separate files:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer glsa_Lkp05hJEtZoAj6fSwedfLyIg5uCuDTW0_9fb7c495" "https://humble-couscous-qp6qgj7r9q729jx4-8080.app.github.dev/api/datasources/proxy/uid/fe6t3evvsomioc" -D headers.txt -o image.png
```

1. **headers.txt** will contain the HTTP headers.
2. **image.png** will contain the response body.

Check **headers.txt** for details about the content type and status of the request. This will give us more clues about what might be going wrong. Once you have this information, we can dive deeper into resolving the issue together. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Let's get to the bottom of this! üòä


Thanks for sharing the headers file. It seems the endpoint is returning JSON data, not an image. That's why the downloaded file isn't displaying correctly as an image.

To fix this, we need to ensure the correct endpoint is being used that returns an image. In Grafana, there are specific endpoints designed for rendering images of panels or dashboards.

Here's an example of how you can update your `curl` command to render a panel image in Grafana:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer glsa_Lkp05hJEtZoAj6fSwedfLyIg5uCuDTW0_9fb7c495" \
"https://humble-couscous-qp6qgj7r9q729jx4-8080.app.github.dev/render/d-solo/your_dashboard_uid/your_panel_id?orgId=1&width=800&height=600&tz=UTC%2B00%3A00" \
--output image.png
```

Replace `your_dashboard_uid` and `your_panel_id` with the actual UID of your dashboard and the ID of the panel you want to render. This command will request an image of the specified panel with the dimensions 800x600.

This should download the image correctly. Give it a try, and let me know if it works. üé®
