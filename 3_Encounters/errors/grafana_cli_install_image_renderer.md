Deprecation warning: The standalone 'grafana-cli' program is deprecated and will be removed in the future. Please update all uses of 'grafana-cli' to 'grafana cli'
Error: ✗ pluginsDir (/var/lib/grafana/plugins) is not a writable directory

Ah, I see what's going on. It looks like there's a permissions issue with the plugin directory. Let's tackle this step-by-step:

1. **Use the correct `grafana cli` command**:
   Since `grafana-cli` is deprecated, use `grafana cli` instead.

   ```bash
   grafana cli plugins install grafana-image-renderer
   ```

2. **Fix the permissions issue**:
   You need to ensure that the directory `/var/lib/grafana/plugins` is writable. You can change the permissions of this directory with the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo chmod -R 775 /var/lib/grafana/plugins
   ```

   If you do not have `sudo` access within the container, you may need to run the container with elevated privileges or modify the Dockerfile to set the correct permissions.

3. **Reinstall the plugin**:
   Now, try installing the plugin again with the correct permissions:

   ```bash
   grafana cli plugins install grafana-image-renderer
   ```

4. **Restart Grafana**:
   After the plugin is installed, restart the Grafana service to apply the changes:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart grafana-server
   ```

If you encounter any further issues, we may need to adjust the Dockerfile or the Kubernetes deployment configuration to ensure the plugin directory is writable upon container startup.

Let's work through these steps and see if that resolves the issue. 😊


chmod -R 775 /var/lib/grafana/plugins
chmod: cannot access '/var/lib/grafana/plugins': No such file or directory


It looks like the `/var/lib/grafana/plugins` directory doesn’t exist in your setup. This could be due to the specific configuration or file paths used in your pod.

Let's try a different approach. First, let's locate the correct plugin directory in your Grafana setup. Usually, it might be under a different path in a containerized environment.

1. **Locate the correct plugin directory**:

   ```bash
   find / -type d -name "plugins" 2>/dev/null
   ```

   This command will search for directories named "plugins" on your system.

2. **Verify the Grafana configuration**:
   - Check where Grafana expects plugins to be located by looking at the Grafana configuration file (`grafana.ini`).
   
   ```bash
   grep 'plugins' /etc/grafana/grafana.ini
   ```

3. **Adjust permissions (if necessary)**:
   Once you find the correct directory, adjust the permissions if needed:

   ```bash
   sudo chmod -R 775 /path/to/your/grafana/plugins
   ```

4. **Install the plugin**:
   With the correct permissions set, install the plugin again:

   ```bash
   grafana cli plugins install grafana-image-renderer
   ```

5. **Restart Grafana**:
   Restart the Grafana service to apply the changes:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart grafana-server
   ```

Please try these steps and let me know if you encounter any further issues. We're getting closer to resolving this! 🚀


Thank you for providing the directories. The most likely plugin directory for Grafana is `/opt/bitnami/grafana/data/plugins`. Let's use that directory to install the image renderer plugin. Here are the steps:

1. **Install the plugin using the Grafana CLI**:

   ```bash
   grafana cli plugins install grafana-image-renderer --pluginsDir /opt/bitnami/grafana/data/plugins
   ```

2. **Adjust permissions if necessary**:

   ```bash
   sudo chmod -R 775 /opt/bitnami/grafana/data/plugins
   ```

3. **Restart Grafana to apply the changes**:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart grafana-server
   ```

By specifying the `--pluginsDir` option, we tell Grafana CLI to use the specified directory for installing plugins.

Give these steps a try and let me know if it works or if you encounter any further issues. We're almost there! 🚀
