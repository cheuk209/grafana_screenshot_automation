# Phase 1 Objectives: Establishing a Data Visualization Environment

## Context 🌌

In this initial phase, our mission is to set up a stable environment for data visualization using Grafana on Minikube. This setup will serve as the foundation for future learning and development activities. By simulating a Kubernetes environment locally with Minikube, we can experiment and learn in a controlled and flexible setting.

## Motives 🚀

1. **Learning Kubernetes**: Understanding how to deploy and manage applications in a Kubernetes environment is a valuable skill. Minikube provides a convenient way to practice these skills locally.

2. **Exploring Grafana**: Grafana is a powerful tool for visualizing data. By setting it up and feeding it with dummy data, we can explore its features and learn how to create meaningful visualizations.

3. **Building a Foundation**: Establishing a stable environment is crucial for future phases of our learning journey. This phase will ensure we have the necessary tools and setup to proceed with more complex tasks.

## Objectives 🛠️

1. **Set Up Minikube**: Install and configure Minikube on the local machine to simulate a Kubernetes environment.

2. **Install Grafana**: Deploy Grafana using Bitnami, ensuring a secure and efficient setup process.

3. **Feed Dummy Data**: Create a data source to generate dummy data and configure Grafana to use this data source.

4. **Visualize Data**: Create basic dashboards in Grafana to visualize the dummy data and explore its features.

## Reflections 🌠

Embarking on this journey is both exciting and challenging. The process of setting up Grafana on Minikube will provide valuable hands-on experience with Kubernetes and data visualization tools. By documenting each step and reflecting on the challenges and successes, we can gain deeper insights and improve our skills.
